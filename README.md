🛡️ Holo-Dock Navigation (Simulated UI)

A futuristic, scroll-triggered navigation anchor designed to simulate a high-end system interface.

Holo-Dock is a pure JavaScript UI component that injects a floating, glassmorphism "capsule" into your website's footer. Designed for aesthetics and user experience, it functions as a dynamic anchor point—guiding users to essential contact information, social links, or simulated system statuses without cluttering the main interface.

It features a procedural holographic animation, deep blurred transparency, and intelligent docking behavior that respects screen real estate.

💎 Concept & Design

Aesthetic: Built on the principles of Glassmorphism, featuring ultra-low opacity backgrounds with strong optical blurring to blend seamlessly into any page environment.

Animation: The central shield icon utilizes a continuous fluid gradient (Holographic Flow), simulating a living, breathing system status.

Behavior:

Smart Docking: The badge remains compacted as a small, unobtrusive indicator while idle.

Proximity Awareness: Automatically expands to reveal textual information (Navigation/Contact) only when interacted with.

Scroll Logic: intelligently hides itself during main content consumption, appearing only when the user reaches the footer area.

🎯 Intended Use

Portfolio Highlights: To display contact methods in a tech-savvy way.

Simulated Systems: For creative landing pages that require a "System Ready" or "Verified" aesthetic.

Minimalist Navigation: As a singular, high-priority action button (e.g., "Contact Me" or "Source Code") that replaces bulky traditional footers.
